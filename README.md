# How to Compile Block Game 2016:

# Requirements

 - **The Source** ðŸ˜‰
 - Visual Studio 2015 and 2017 with the necessary build tools. (v140_xp)
 - DirectX 9
 - Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015
 - [Windows 7 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279)
 - Dependencies used in the source (which will be mentioned in a sec)
 - A brain and some patients (Compiling does take a lot of time)!

## Dependencies

In order to compile you will need some libraries/dependencies to be able to compile.

## Organizing files and folders

Now before we start compiling anything we have to organize where everything goes.

 1. Create a Folder on your root called "Trunk2012" (It should be like C:\Trunk2012)
 2. Create another folder inside Trunk2012 Called "Contribs"
 3. Create another folder inside Trunk2012 Called "Build"
 4. Put your block game source inside Build folder
 5. Download/Extract all the dependencies
 6. Put boost inside the "Contribs" directory (The path should look like this: C:\Trunk2012\Contribs\boost_1_56_0)
 7. Put C++ netlib dependency inside the "Contribs" directory (The path should look like this: C:\Trunk2012\Contribs\cpp-netlib-0.11.0-final)
 8. Put DSBaseClasses inside the "Contribs" directory (The path should look like this: C:\Trunk2012\Contribs\DSBaseClasses)
 9. Put SDK inside the "Contribs" directory (The path should should look like this: C:\Trunk2012\Contribs\SDK)
 10. Put SDL 2.0.4 inside the "Contribs" directory (The path should look like this: C:\Trunk2012\Contribs\SDL2.0.4)
 11. Duplicate SDL2.0.4 Folder but rename the copy to just "SDL2"  (The path should look like this: C:\Trunk2012\Contribs\SDL2)
 12. Put Telemetry inside the "Contribs" directory (The path should look like this: C:\Trunk2012\Contribs\Telemetry) (Inside should be another folder called Telemetry2SDKWin32_20M)
 13. Create a folder inside "Contribs" called "VMProtectWin_2.13" and put the 2 Header files of VM Protect *(aka VMP)* Inside of "VMProtectWin_2.13".
 14. Put w3c-libwww-5.4.0 dependency inside the "Contribs" directory (The path should look like this: C:\Trunk2012\Contribs\w3c-libwww-5.4.0)
 15. Create a folder in Contribs Called "windows" and another inside "windows" called "x86" and place the zlib and curl dependencies inside there: (It should look like this C:\Trunk2012\windows\x86\curl\curl-7.43.0 and C:\Trunk2012\windows\x86\zlib\zlib-1.2.8) (Note how those dependencies are in nested directories)
 16. Create a folder in Contribs Called "VMP" and put the vmp misc files inside there.

>The Contribs folder should look like this:<br>

*(Ignore the fact that the "VMP" folder is missing from the screenshot)*

## Setting up the environment
In order for the source to know where to find the depedencies you need to create an environment variable on the system, To do this, Create a system variable with the name "CONTRIB_PATH" and the value being the contrib path (C:\Trunk2012\Contribs) <br>

*(In the screenshot it shows just C:\Trunk2012 but ignore that because I put the contribs all in the root of Trunk2012 instead of a dedicated folder called Contribs)*
